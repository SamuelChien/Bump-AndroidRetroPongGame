OVERVIEW

Bump is a hybrid of the classic arcade games Pong and Space Invaders.
In the distant future, spaceships have evolved to become no bigger than
thin pancake-shaped vessels. Protect it from the alien invaders, but
instead of guns, your bankrupt space military can only provide you with
their last high-tech indestructible, self-propelling ball with which you
must bounce toward those pesky aliens. Defeat them all with that
all-powerful bouncing ball! Careful though, the ball can only return to
your ship after being dropped a certain number of times; lose it and
you'll be tried by your own government for treason!

This is a very primitive version, made by a team with no prior experience
in mobile or game development within the span of 48 hours. It's far from
being fully playable, but we had a lot of fun with the concept and are
prepared to continue to support this project with the hope of producing
a fun, market-ready game.

KNOWN ISSUES

So far, a lot of features we've meant to include have not been
implemented yet. These include:

- Enemy movement
- Enemy hostile action (shooting at paddle)
- Item drops
- Finite lives (currently, game will continue even when life meter
reaches zero)
- Multiple levels of increasing difficulty
- Hiscore system
- A better physics engine and collision detection system
- Support for multiple resolutions (currently only works for phones
with 1280x720 resolution or higher)
- More sound effects and graphics

These are some known problems with this version of the application:
- Lots of bugs and random in-game freezes
- Music continues to play when phone screen turns off
- General lack of code readability
